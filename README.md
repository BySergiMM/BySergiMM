### Hi there im Sergi👋

🚀 About Me

🎓 I am Sergi Martí, Back End Application Developer and I have experience in Web Development with personal projects. I'm finishing my studies of Higher Module of Multiplatform Application Development, I want to work to develop myself personally and professionally. 

👨‍💻 My work experience is not very extensive because I have just finished my studies.
In my first internship contract, in an intermediate module, I worked on basic computer software, computer repair, computer maintenance and installation. This was in VianiComputers, a company in Barcelona. 
In my second internship contract, this last year, has been based on creating a website from 0 to upload the travel offers so that more people could see it, apart from helping in daily things in the shop, both creating customers in the program, records, and other various things, in this case I worked for Carrefour Viajes, specifically in Sant Boi.

🎸 Outside of the tech world as well, I like to strive to develop new skills. My hobbies range from entrepreneurship, reading personal development books, to going to the gym.

Currently I have discovered this hobby of reading and I am delighted, I had never liked reading, because I read things that did not interest me, but now I have started reading about personal development and has turned my opinion about reading, I am currently reading Atomic Habits, and I have pending, 48 laws of power, Rich Dad Poor Dad, among others. These books help me growing up as a person and getting financial control.

✈️ I also love travelling. I think it is a very important way to see different realities of the world, and to be able to meet different cultures and people from all over the world has to be something unique.
