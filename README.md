### Hi there im Sergi👋

🚀 About Me
🎓 I am Sergi Martí, Back End Application Developer and I have experience in Web Development with personal projects. I'm finishing my studies of Higher Module of Multiplatform Application Development and I'm thinking about doing Higher Module of Web Development, depending on my work situation, as I want to work online to be able to travel around the world while I do what I like.

👨‍💻 My work experience is not very extensive because I have just finished my studies.
In my first internship contract, in an intermediate module, I worked on basic computer software, computer repair, computer maintenance and installation. This was in VianiComputers, a company in Barcelona. 
In my second internship contract, this last year, has been based on creating a website from 0 to upload the travel offers so that more people could see it, apart from helping in daily things in the shop, both creating customers in the program, records, and other various things, in this case I worked for Carrefour Travel, specifically in Sant Boi (the website that I created is: https://viajesnalanda.es/).

🎸 Outside the world of technology also, I like to push myself to develop new skills. My hobbies range from entrepreneurship to reading personal development books.

Currently I have discovered this hobby of reading and I am delighted, I had never liked reading, because I read things that did not interest me, but now I have started reading about personal development and has turned my opinion about reading, I am currently reading Atomic Habits, and I have pending, 48 laws of power, Rich Dad Poor Dad, among others. These books help me growing up as a person and getting financial control.

✈️ I also love to travel. If everything works as I have planned, at the end of next year, 2024, I would like to go to live in Australia, and from there start my world tour, as I believe that from the experiences you learn a lot and I value a lot that this is possible thanks to teleworking.
